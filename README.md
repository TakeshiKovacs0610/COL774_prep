# COL774 - Machine Learning

This repository contains assignments for the course [COL774 (Machine Learning)](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~parags/teaching/col774/) by Prof. Parag Singla during the Fall Semester 2023-24

COL774 is hands down one of the most difficult and interesting course at IIT Delhi. Prof. Parag gives a significant weightage to exams which are often extremely difficult, but fun to solve if your basic concepts are clear, and you have a good imagination ;). Now, in my opinion there is a pretty simple way to score a 10 in this course. Here are a few tips that will help you throughout this course:

 - Do not listen top people whio say machine learning is hoax or scam. They are just kidding themselves. Machine Learning is a very important skill today. Perhaps, as important as how knowing how to access the internet is.
 - Keep in touch with the classes. Try to attend as many classes as you can because Prof. Parag is one of the best professors at the institute. His way of teaching is simple but elegant. He explains all concepts quite nicely, and also gives poitners on how to attempt exams.
 - Andrew Ng's Notes. Very important. The math in them is quite nicely explained and they are actually very simple to understand.
 - Vector Calculus and Optimisation. You will not survive this course if you do not have a good grasp over vector calculus. As for optimisation, it comes in handy while studying SVMs and PCA. Be thorough with the theory of lagrangians and the KKT Property for Dual problems.
 - PYQs: You can either axe your grade or do PYQs. It's as simple as that.
